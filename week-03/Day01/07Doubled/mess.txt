The Zen of Pytho
by Tim Peter

Beautiful is beter than ugly
Explicit is beter than implicit
Simple is beter than complex
Complex is beter than complicated
Flat is beter than nested
Sparse is beter than dense
Readability counts
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
Although practicality beats purity
Erors should never pas silently
Unles explicitly silenced
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to gues
There should be one- and preferably only one -obvious way to do it
Although that way may not be obvious at first unles you're Dutch
Now is beter than never
Although never is often beter than *right* now
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a god idea
Namespaces are one honking great idea - let's do more of those
